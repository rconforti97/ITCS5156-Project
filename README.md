# Machine-Learning---Handwriting
For ITCS5156 - Applied Machine Learning that I am taking Spring 2022. The rough idea is to use machine learning to identify handwriting. 
I have seen studies done on cursive handwriting and testing to see how accurate it can read it to classifying the numbers in an image correctly.
I am personally leaning more towards having images of numbers to classify because then I can use my family, friends, and myself to add photos and try to trick/train the model.
